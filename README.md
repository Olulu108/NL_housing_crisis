# Analysing Housing Crisis in the Netherlands

## Project Overview

This project is inspired by the ongoing housing crisis in the Netherlands. Our goal is to analyze various factors contributing to the crisis and share key findings. A significant part of our research focuses on the impact of immigration on house prices.

## Key Findings

### 1. Immigration and House Prices

We began by investigating whether the rising number of immigrants influences house prices. The first two graphs indicate that both house prices and the number of immigrants have been increasing over the years.

However, when examining the percentage of immigrants within the total population, we see that it remains relatively stable over time.

### 2. Case Study: The Hague

To explore this topic further, we focused on cities with a high percentage of immigrants, including Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Utrecht. We selected The Hague for a closer examination.

#### Neighborhood Analysis

The neighborhoods in The Hague are categorized based on the proportion of Dutch-born residents (left) versus people born outside the Netherlands (right).

In areas with a higher percentage of people born outside the Netherlands, most residents live in rented houses. In contrast, neighborhoods with a majority of Dutch-born residents have higher homeownership rates.

Additionally, houses in neighborhoods with a dominant Dutch-born population tend to be more expensive.

#### Housing Price Trends

A graph comparing price fluctuations over the years. Orange represents areas with a dominant Dutch-born population. Green represents neighborhoods with a high proportion of immigrants.
The price rise and fluctuation are more significant in neighborhoods with a majority of Dutch-born people.

This analysis suggests that the rising number of immigrants does not drive house price increases. Instead, prices in areas with a high proportion of people born outside the Netherlands remain relatively stable and low.

## Conclusion

Our findings challenge the assumption that immigration directly impacts rising house prices. Instead, ownership patterns and demographic compositions appear to play a more significant role in shaping the housing market.
